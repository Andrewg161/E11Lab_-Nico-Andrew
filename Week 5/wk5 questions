3a. The two sets of data have greater statistical difference for the "PM's" and Pressure but not as statistically different for everything else 
3b. Refer to 3a where the ones that are statisticaly different are seperated by more than 3 standard deviations of the uncertainty mean.(a lot of the work for this can be fuond in the week 6 ipynb)


3c(from Week 6 activity). Since our distributions were not well described by a Gaussian, I do think that we did not take enough data for the central limit theorem to apply.
